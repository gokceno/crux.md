# crux.md

Crux is an open-source, headless data platform that exposes your data stored in future-proof text (markdown and YAML) files to the public. It offers two types of data gateways: programmatic and semantic (WIP).

Programmatic gateway gives you GraphQL endpoints to "query" your markdown/YAML data against a schema, while semantic gateway (WIP) allows you to interact with your data simply by asking questions.
